   <p><strong>Yamaha</strong> officially unveiled a new generation of R1, similar to the contemporary<strong>YZR M1</strong> . <i>Yamaha</i> claims a wet weight of <u>199kg</u>  (439 lb). Engine changes include a decreased <u>bore-to-stroke</u> ratio, a larger airbox, a finger-follower valve system, and fracture split titanium conrods. Magnesium wheels are standard, and information is presented to the rider through a user-customizable thin-film display.<br>The new bike has an electronics package that includes a sophisticated Traction Control System (TCS), a Slide Control System (SCS), an anti-wheelie Lift Control System (LIF), linked antilock brakes, a Launch Control System (LCS), a Quick Shift System (QSS), and selectable power modes. The Slide Control System on the R1 is the first on a production motorcycle.Information is fed to the bike through a six-axis inertial measurement unit and other sensors over 100 times a second. Power delivery is tapered through throttle valve manipulation and ignition and fuel cuts.</p>
